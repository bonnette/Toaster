# Toaster
A project that uses an ESP32 (Arduino) to simulate an bluetooth connected "Toaster"<br/>
The iPhone connects to the "Toaster" and follows the toasting process by changing the icons on the phone.<br/>
This project allowed me to understand the bluetooth communications between an Arduino and an iPhone.
